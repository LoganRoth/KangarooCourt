# Kangaroo Court

This app is based on a game played by myself and my housemates at our University house. This app is a work in progress.

Rules:
1. When someone does something deserving of "bad housemates points" add them to the feed as positive points. 
    - Ex. Not doing their dishes for 2 weeks.
3. When someone does something deserving of "good housemates points" add them to the feed as negative points.
    - Ex. Getting Tim's breakfast for everyone after a night out.
4. If someone diasgress with a point they received they can "contest" it, this will give them the chance to speak their case at court and have the house vote on if it is deserved or not.
    - Ex. Someone was given points for not doing their dishes, but the dishes referred to were not theirs.
5. At some point the house will decide to "Hold Court" where everyone will vote on the contested points after hearing the arguments from the defendants.
6. At the end of this process, the person with the most points will be declared "The Worst Housemates of the Month" ("of the <Whatever>").
7. Not a requirement, but generally being the worst housemate will come with some kind of punishment
    - Ex. Can't sit on any of the couches in the house for the next week.
